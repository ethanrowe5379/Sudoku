Moved Over to IntelliJ
Testing out the algorithm with purely row and column checks.
Begun Soft-locking itself as values that were needed for both row and column were being utilised already.
Hoping Box condition will rectify this.
Currently Developing Box checks.
Implementing via row and col coordinates with then link to the top left cell of the box;
Will then iterate through.
Box Condition now works correctly
Will test both row and col conditions tmr.
